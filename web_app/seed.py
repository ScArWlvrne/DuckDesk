"""seed.py

Idempotent seeding script for development.
- Reads DATABASE_URL from the environment (falls back to local postgres).
- Will only insert users/tickets if the database appears empty (both users and tickets tables have zero rows).
- Inserts three admins (keeps the given real admin emails), a few test advisors and students (fake emails),
  and 10 tickets with varied created_at / last_updated / status / priority values for sorting tests.

Written in collaboration with ChatGPT.
